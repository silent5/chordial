**Chordial MIDI** is a MIDI Effect that outputs four different MIDI notes quantized to a variety of chord shapes.

Features in a nutshell:

- Continuously variable waveshape from sine to triangle to saw (Chordial only).
- Drone mode for...drones. Env mode (Chordial)/Key mode (Chordial MIDI) for traditional monophonic playing.
- 4 different chord voicings: Close, Drop 2, Drop 3, and Spread.
- 4 different chord inversions: Root, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd.
- 4 different chord qualities: Major, Minor, and two user selectable qualities (sus2, sus2maj7, sus4, sus4maj7, dominant, half-diminished). 
- Voice toggles for turning individual chord voices on and off. Also includes a fade control (Chordial only) that applies a variable fade-in/fade-out to the toggle. With Chordial MIDI, a toggle fade is easily handled by the receiving instrument's envelopes.
- A voice output section that lets you route individual voices to their own audio track (Chordial only).
- A simple MIDI delay section that lets you delay each individual chord voice by a set amount, either freely or synchronized to your Live set tempo (Chordial MIDI only).
